          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a data professional who enjoys solving problems and uncovering
            insights that drive real impact. With a background in finance, I
            bring a unique perspective to the table, one that combines
            analytical thinking with business context.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a big believer in continuous improvement, both in my work and in
            myself. Data and machine learning are always evolving, and I make it
            a point to keep learning right alongside them. I regularly attend
            local data meetups to connect with others in the field and stay
            inspired by the projects and ideas people are sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a strong teammate is something I take seriously. I believe
            that when we work together and lean on each other’s strengths, we
            can solve far more than we ever could alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a gritty, reliable team player, one of my proudest
            accomplishments is being the first in my family to graduate from
            college while working two jobs to pay for tuition.
