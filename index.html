          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a data professional who enjoys solving problems and uncovering
            insights that drive real impact. With a background in finance, I
            bring a unique perspective that combines analytical thinking with
            business context.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m someone who enjoys challenging themselves with work projects
            that allow me to grow my skillset. Some of my recent work includes
            building a Markov Analysis model to predict the probability of the
            next month’s charge-off amount, resulting in a margin of error of
            2%. Using SQL and Python, I was able to clean and transform the data
            to capture the historical percentage changes of borrowers’
            delinquencies from month to month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I’m passionate about growing my skillset through
            competitions and side projects. This past year, I competed in the
            NFL Big Data Bowl, using real in-game data to create a Random Forest
            Classifier to predict the probability that the next play would be a
            run play based on the offense’s pre-snap movement. This achieved an
            accuracy of 80.9% and a ROC AUC of 87.4% on the test set. I also
            built a ETL pipeline using Community Transit’s publicly available
            data, transforming and loading it into structured tables for end
            user access.
          </p>
          <p>
            As someone who’s been an end user in the data lifecycle, I
            understand the value of clean, organized data and the challenges
            when it’s not. Continuous improvement is a core part of how I work
            and how I approach life. I regularly attend local data meetups in
            the Seattle area to connect with others in the field and stay
            inspired by the projects and ideas people share.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a strong teammate is something I take a lot of pride in. I
            believe that when we work together and lean on each other’s
            strengths, then we can solve far more than if we were alone. I’m a
            gritty, reliable team player, and one of my proudest accomplishments
            is being the first in my family to graduate college while working
            two jobs to pay for tuition.
